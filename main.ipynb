    "# 1. Dataset Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will construct a dataset consisting of question-answer pairs that will be used to train our BERT-based question-answering model. The dataset consists of a set of **1015** data points, which were sourced from ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset follows a SQuAD-style format, where each question corresponds to a passage of text (context), and the answer is a span of text within that context. We will ensure that each question is answered by the corresponding passage and that the `answer_start` positions are correctly specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. We will structure the dataset in a JSON format with the following attributes:\n",
    "   - `context`: The paragraph or passage from which answers can be extracted.\n",
    "   - `qas`: A list of questions and their corresponding answers with the `answer_start` indicating where the answer begins in the `context`.\n",
    "2. We will include **1000-1500** question-answer pairs in total, ensuring that they are diverse and representative of the content on pressure ulcers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"context\": \"Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers...\",\n",
    "  \"qas\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"id\": 1,\n",

    "      \"answers\": [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"text\": \"bedsores or decubitus ulcers\",\n",
    "          \"answer_start\": 38\n",

    "\n",
    "Data pre-processing is an essential step before training a model. In this section, we will preprocess the dataset in preparation for training the BERT model. This will include **tokenization** and **padding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Loading the Dataset**:\n",
    "   We will first load the dataset into a Python dictionary (as a JSON file) to ensure we have all the questions, answers, and contexts in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tokenization**:\n",
    "   Tokenization is the process of converting the text (questions and contexts) into tokens that can be fed into the model. We will use the `BertTokenizerFast` to tokenize both the questions and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Padding**:\n",
    "   Since the tokenized sequences can have varying lengths, we will pad them to a fixed length to ensure that all inputs are of equal length. This helps with batch processing during model training."

    "# Training Arguments Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the configuration of the **TrainingArguments** used for fine-tuning the BERT model. The parameters selected are designed to achieve an optimal balance between training efficiency and model performance. Below is a justification for each parameter used:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "1. **output_dir**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `./bert-qa`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This is the directory where the model and checkpoints will be saved during training. It allows us to keep track of the model versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **evaluation_strategy**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `epoch`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: The model will be evaluated after each epoch. This ensures that we can monitor its progress throughout training and make adjustments if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **learning_rate**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `2e-5`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: A common learning rate for fine-tuning BERT-based models is `2e-5`. It allows the model to learn effectively without making large, unstable updates to the weights. This value has been widely used in the literature for similar tasks and provides good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **per_device_train_batch_size**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `16`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: A batch size of `16` is used to increase the speed of training without overloading the GPU memory. Larger batch sizes can help with convergence but may lead to memory issues on GPUs with limited memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **per_device_eval_batch_size**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `16`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: The evaluation batch size is also set to `16`, which matches the training batch size. This helps ensure consistency in processing and allows us to evaluate the model efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **num_train_epochs**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `3`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: We train for 3 epochs to avoid overfitting while ensuring sufficient training. The choice of 3 epochs is a tradeoff between training time and model generalization. We will monitor the model’s performance during training to ensure it does not start overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **weight_decay**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `0.01`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: A weight decay of `0.01` is used as a regularization technique to prevent the model from overfitting. Weight decay applies a penalty to large weights, which encourages simpler models that generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **save_strategy**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `epoch`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: The model will be saved after each epoch. This allows us to retain checkpoints for each training stage, which can be helpful for later model analysis or resuming training from a specific epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **logging_dir**:\n",
    "   - **Value**: `./logs`\n",
    "   - **Justification**: This is the directory where the logs of the training process will be stored. It helps with monitoring the training progress and debugging any issues that arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **logging_steps**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `50`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Logs are generated every 50 steps during training to provide regular updates on the model's progress. This frequency can be adjusted depending on the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **warmup_steps**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `500`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Warmup steps gradually increase the learning rate from 0 to the specified learning rate (`2e-5`) over the first 500 steps. This helps the model to start learning slowly and avoid large updates early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **load_best_model_at_end**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `True`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: This option ensures that after training, we load the best model based on the evaluation results. This is particularly useful when monitoring metrics like validation loss or accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **metric_for_best_model**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `eval_loss`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: We use `eval_loss` as the metric to determine the best model. Lower loss indicates better performance, so we will select the model with the lowest evaluation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **greater_is_better**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `False`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Since we are monitoring `eval_loss`, lower loss values indicate better performance. Therefore, `greater_is_better` is set to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **report_to**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `tensorboard`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: TensorBoard will be used for visualizing training progress and metrics such as loss, accuracy, and others. This provides an intuitive and interactive way to monitor the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **fp16**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `True`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Mixed precision training is enabled to speed up the training process and reduce memory usage. This is especially helpful when working with large models like BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **dataloader_num_workers**:\n",
    "    - **Value**: `4`\n",
    "    - **Justification**: Setting the number of workers to `4` helps to load data more efficiently during training. This allows the CPU to process multiple data batches in parallel, improving training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "The chosen hyperparameters are aimed at optimizing training efficiency while preventing overfitting. The learning rate is conservative, and the batch size is set to a reasonable value for the available hardware. Regular evaluation, warmup steps, and logging will ensure the training process is monitored effectively.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this project, we have developed a question-answering system using the BERT architecture to answer questions related to pressure ulcers. Through various stages, we have prepared the dataset, tokenized the text, and fine-tuned the BERT model on the task of extractive question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of our model using **BERTScore** has shown the following results:\n",
    "- **Precision**: 0.900\n",
    "- **Recall**: 0.820\n",
    "- **F1 Score**: 0.858\n",
    "\n",
    "These scores indicate that our model performs well in terms of both precision and recall, with a balanced performance between them. The F1 score of 0.858 demonstrates that the model is effectively capturing relevant information while maintaining a low false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model has successfully demonstrated the potential of using pre-trained transformer models like BERT for domain-specific question answering tasks. However, further optimization, including fine-tuning on a larger and more diverse dataset, could improve its accuracy even further. Additionally, using techniques like **data augmentation** and **early stopping** might help mitigate overfitting and further enhance model performance.\n"
